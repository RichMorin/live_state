# LiveState

This project exists to facilitate building the servier side of embedded apps, or micro-front-end apps, 
in Elixir. 

## Installation

This package can be installed
by adding `live_state` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:live_state, "~> 0.2.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

We'll add some better instructions, but for now an [example](https://github.com/gaslight/live_state_comments) will probably help the most.
